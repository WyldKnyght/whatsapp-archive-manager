## SOLID Principles

- **S**: Single Responsibility - One reason to change
- **O**: Open/Closed - Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**: Liskov Substitution - Subtypes must be substitutable
- **I**: Interface Segregation - Many specific interfaces
- **D**: Dependency Inversion - Depend on abstractions

## Clean Code Principles

1. **Functions should do one thing**
2. **Don't repeat yourself (DRY)**
3. **Keep functions small**
4. **Descriptive names**
5. **Minimal arguments**
